I am ML research scientist at [Abridge](https://www.abridge.com) working on training language models that aid and assist doctors in various clinical documentation tasks. I obtained a __computer science Ph.D.__ at the University of Toronto and was a graduate student researcher at the [Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Research](https://tdccbr.med.utoronto.ca/) and the [Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://vectorinstitute.ai/), where my work centred on __natural language processing (NLP)__ and __natural language understanding (NLU)__ of scientific text, particularly biomedical literature. I previously interned at [Ai2](https://ai2-web.apps.allenai.org/) (on the [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/about) team) and at [Semantic Health](https://www.semantichealth.ai/). I completed an undergraduate degree at the University of Ottawa, graduating with a B.Sc in biochemistry. I completed an M.Sc. in computer science at the University of Toronto. When I am not 💻 I like to 🚵‍♂️, 🏂 and 🏋️‍♂️.
